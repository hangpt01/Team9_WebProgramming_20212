        <p style="font-size:18px"> The unique number assigned to all full-time and part-time students at a post-secondary institution. </p>
        <h2> National Identification Number </h2>

            <br/> for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governmentally-related functions.

        <h2> License Plate Number </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px"> The number in the metal or plastic plate attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes. </p>
        <h2> Receipt Number </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px"> The receipt number will contain three letters followed by ten numbers. The letters identify the USCIS service center that is processing your application and will be either EAC, WAC, LIN, SRC, NBC, MSC, or IOE. 
            <br/> The ten numbers that follow are a combination of the date your case was opened and your unique case number. </p>
        <h2> Passport Number </h2>
